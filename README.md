# Student Chatroom Feature — Product Case Study

A product case study focused on designing, validating, and measuring an in-dashboard peer-to-peer communication feature for students to reduce reliance on external messaging platforms and improve academic engagement.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Students frequently rely on external tools such as WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Telegram to communicate with peers about coursework. While familiar, these tools operate outside the learning environment, leading to fragmented discussions, loss of academic context, and reduced engagement within the platform.

This case study explores the discovery, design, and validation of a **native Chatroom feature** embedded directly within a student dashboard to enable contextual, classroom-based communication.

The goal: **make peer collaboration seamless, contextual, and measurable within the learning platform itself.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students do not have access to an integrated peer-to-peer communication feature within the learning dashboard, forcing them to rely on external messaging platforms. This results in fragmented discussions, diminished engagement in the academic context, and reduced visibility into peer collaboration on the platform.

---

## 🧠 Product Hypothesis

If a dedicated Chatroom feature is introduced within the student dashboard—offering a familiar, classroom-scoped messaging experience that supports both group and private peer communication—then students will adopt it as their primary channel for academic interaction, reducing dependency on external platforms and increasing in-platform engagement.

## 📊 Goals & Success Metrics

Feature success is measured using clearly defined, instrumentable metrics:

- **Feature Adoption**  
  `(Weekly Active Chat Users ÷ Weekly Active Students) × 100`

- **Feature Retention**  
  `(Chat users active in Month N ∩ Month N+1 ÷ Chat users active in Month N) × 100`

- **Peer-to-Peer Engagement**  
  `(Students sending ≥ N messages per week ÷ Weekly Active Students)`

- **Chat Participation Rate**  
  `(Students who sent ≥1 message ÷ Total enrolled students)`

- **Message Volume**  
  `(Total messages sent ÷ Active classrooms per day)`

- **Student Satisfaction**  
  `(Positive chat feedback responses ÷ Total chat feedback responses)`

- **Session Duration Lift**  
  `((Avg session duration for chat users − Avg session duration for non-chat users) ÷ Avg session duration for non-chat users)`

---

## 🧪 Validation Plan

To validate the hypothesis, the Chatroom feature is launched as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** with a controlled rollout.

- **MVP Rollout**  
  Released to a limited set of classrooms

- **Measurement Window**  
  Adoption, engagement, and retention tracked over 30, 60, and 90 days

- **Experiment Design**  
  Chat-enabled classrooms are compared against non-chat classrooms across adoption, engagement, session duration, and retention metrics

- **Decision Criteria**  
  Scale or iterate the feature platform-wide based on predefined success thresholds

## 🧩 Feature Scope (MVP)

### 1. Classroom Group Chat (Default)
- Auto-enrolled class-wide group chat
- No setup or joining links required
- Discussions remain tied to classroom context

### 2. Member List Panel
- Displays all enrolled classmates
- Enables peer discovery and visibility
- One-click access to private chats

### 3. Private One-to-One Chat
- Scoped strictly to classroom members
- Enables focused peer collaboration
- Keeps academic conversations within the platform

### 4. Familiar Messaging Interface
- WhatsApp-like UI patterns
- Text-first experience
- Low learning curve to drive adoption

## ⚖️ Key Product Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Classroom-Based Chat vs Global Chat**  
  Chose classroom-scoped communication to preserve relevance and context

- **Private Messaging Limited to Classmates**  
  Prevents misuse and maintains academic focus

- **Text-First MVP vs Rich Media**  
  Prioritized speed, simplicity, and scalability over feature richness

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- **Low Adoption Due to Habitual Use of External Apps**  
  → Make Chatroom the default entry point from courses and lessons

- **Off-Topic Conversations**  
  → Usage guidelines, lightweight moderation, instructor visibility

- **Knowledge Fragmentation via Private Chats**  
  → Encourage group discussions and highlight unresolved questions

- **Performance & Scalability Risks**  
  → Text-first MVP, pagination, gradual infrastructure scaling

- **Privacy & Misuse Concerns**  
  → Classroom-only access, blocking/reporting, audit logs
